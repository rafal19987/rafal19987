# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi,<br>
I am a frontend developer ;)
<br>
I have roots in the electrical installation trade, and I became interested in frontend development about 2 years ago. Since then, I have acquired skills in frontend-related technologies, focusing on creating websites and web applications. I have completed projects for various companies using different technologies. My excellent knowledge of the basics of JavaScript allows me to quickly adapt to any framework.
<br>
Below, you will find some of my recent projects, which are still in progress.
I also encourage you to check out my portfolio website, itâ€™s a few months old but I still like it :)
<br>
In addition to my development skills, I have highly developed soft skills that I gained from working in sales. I am also interested in online marketing.
